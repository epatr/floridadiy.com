The roots of this project start in 2002, when I was working at deviantART and learned this new dynamic web language they used called PHP. I created a punk music community called I Hate Music, which was sort-of a combination of Wikipedia, YouTube, and Myspace, before any of those things existed. 

In 2006, I decided to focus in on my home state, Florida, and create a way to post shows and organize events outside of Myspace. 

Much later, in 2017, I opened the St Augustine Music Project, which was an even smaller scale effort to get shows in my town off Facebook.
